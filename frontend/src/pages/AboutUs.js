            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Every year, millions of dogs visit veterinarians, generating invaluable medical data that could unlock breakthrough discoveries in canine health. Yet most of this data remains isolated in individual practice records, limiting our collective understanding of canine diseases, treatments, and outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long Live Our Dogs bridges this gap by creating the world's largest open database of canine health records, enabling researchers to identify patterns, develop better treatments, and ultimately help dogs live longer, healthier lives.
